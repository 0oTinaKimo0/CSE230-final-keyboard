# CSE 230 Final Project
## Team: Tina Jin, Bill Hsu, Yi Zhang, Darlene Jiang
## Proposal
### Project Idea
We intend to implement a playable piano keyboard with additional features like playing MIDI files or an interactive piano tutorial.
### Useful Packages
We are going to utilize the Brick library for the TUI, and the Euterpea library for playing musical notes.
### Plan and Goals
To start with, we are going to implement a basic piano keyboard, where each note is bound to a key on the computer keyboard. As time permits we are going to add more features. The end goal is either a education software with an auto-scroll piano sheet music, or a rhythm game with a scoreboard.
