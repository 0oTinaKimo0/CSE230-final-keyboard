# CSE 230 Final Project
### Team: Tina Jin, Bill Hsu, Yi Zhang, Darlene Jiang
## Proposal
#### Project Idea
We intend to implement a playable piano keyboard with additional features like playing MIDI files or an interactive piano tutorial.
#### Useful Packages
We are going to utilize the [Brick](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/brick) library for the TUI, and the [Euterpea](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Euterpea) library for playing individual musical notes.
#### Plan and Goals
To start with, we are going to implement a basic piano keyboard, where each note is bound to a key on the computer keyboard. When a key is hit, we want to highlight that key while playing the note bound to the key. If time permits we are going to add more features. The end goal is either a education software with auto-scroll piano sheet music, or a rhythm game with a scoreboard.
